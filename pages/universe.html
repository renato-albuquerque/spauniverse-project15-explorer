        <h1>The Universe</h1>
        <p>The word Universe derives from the Latin universum. The Latin word was used by Cicero and later by other authors in the same sense as it is used today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum — first used by Lucretius in Book IV of his “On the Nature of Things” — which connects un, uni (one) with vorsum, versum (meaning "something rolled, rolled or changed").</p>
